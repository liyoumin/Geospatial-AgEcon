Tariff has significant effects on agricultural trade, large country tariff can shift global price.
Is here any spillover effects on agricultural environment due to tariff?

We need to know interactions between agricultural productions (which imposed on tariffs by large countries) and environment. 
Here is a good example, alfalfa (input) and dairy (output), trade between China and U.S.

Dose alfalfa is a dought crop?

How alfalfa affect environments (soil, water) with 
irrigation/nonirrigation, more intensive or less intensive operation area, cash crop or rotaion crop, export more or less?

How alfalfa changes impacts on dairy production and trade? Any spillover effects on small farms and consumer nurtrients?

Dairy farm emmission (GHG) impacts on air/water quality have been disscused a lot. But input (alfalfa, forge, hay) impacts on the system still not clear.
